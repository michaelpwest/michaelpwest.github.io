      Originally from Brisbane, Australia and living in New York since 2012, I have always had a passion for technology and creating
      new apps and products. Starting as a Java developer in 2003, I picked up web development soon after and since 2006
      have worked for a few different companies, helping to develop their products. I now manage a team of software engineers and
      in my spare time I develop mobile apps and video games.
      <br /><br />
      Outside of developing I have a passion for learning new skills. Over the years I have learned some useful and otherwise
      interesting skills such as graphic design (which you will see throughout my apps), intermediate level Spanish,
      electric and bass guitar, and juggling.
